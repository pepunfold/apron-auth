# apron-auth

Stateless OAuth 2.0 protocol library with PKCE, token refresh, and provider-specific revocation.

## What is apron-auth?

Provider-specific OAuth knowledge — endpoints, auth methods, PKCE quirks, error classification, and revocation — encoded as a library so your application doesn't have to maintain it.

| What                 | Why                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provider presets     | Endpoints, auth methods, PKCE toggles, scope separators, and revocation for multiple providers out of the box.                            |
| Error classification | Distinguishes permanent failures (revoked token, invalid client) from transient ones so callers know whether to retry or re-authenticate. |
| Revocation support   | Providers all revoke differently (POST, DELETE, GET, Basic auth, query params) — presets include the right handler when available.          |
| Auth method handling | `client_secret_post` vs `client_secret_basic` — picked from your config and handled by authlib under the hood.                            |
| PKCE (S256)          | Generated automatically when the provider supports it, no setup needed.                                                                   |

apron-auth is stateless. It doesn't store tokens, manage sessions, or hold database connections — you bring your own storage, apron-auth handles the protocol.

## Installation

```bash
# via uv
uv add apron-auth

# via pip
pip install apron-auth
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Usage

### With a provider preset

Presets bundle the endpoints, auth method, PKCE config, and revocation handler for a given provider into a single call.

```python
from apron_auth.providers import google

config, revocation_handler = google.preset(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",  # pragma: allowlist secret
    scopes=["openid", "email", "profile"],
)
```

If you use [apron-tools](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/apron-tools), scopes come from capability groups instead of being hardcoded:

```python
from apron_tools.providers.google.gmail.scopes import CAPABILITY_GROUP as GMAIL

config, revocation_handler = google.preset(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",  # pragma: allowlist secret
    scopes=GMAIL.scopes,
)
```

### Any OpenID Connect provider

A provider that implements OpenID Connect publishes its own endpoints, so there is
nothing to hardcode: discover them from the issuer and hand the result to the preset.
This covers Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Entra ID, Authentik, Zitadel, Dex, and Ping without
a module per product.

```python
from apron_auth import OAuthClient
from apron_auth.providers import oidc

metadata = await oidc.discover("https://sso.example.com/realms/acme")

config, revocation_handler = oidc.preset(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",  # pragma: allowlist secret
    scopes=["email", "profile"],
    metadata=metadata,
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
)

client = OAuthClient(
    config,
    identity_handler=oidc.identity_handler(metadata, client_id="your-client-id"),
)
```

The issuer is a trust anchor, not just an address: `discover` refuses a configuration
document that names a different one (OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0, section 4.3), and the
discovered issuer carries onto the config so the authorization-response `iss` is validated
before a code is redeemed (RFC 9207).

Unlike every other provider here, the identity handler is passed explicitly. Handler
inference matches a config's OAuth hosts against each provider's known hosts, and a
generic connection's hosts are whatever the operator configured — so `oidc` registers no
resolver rather than making inference ambiguous for the providers that can answer.

ID tokens are read from the token-endpoint response, where TLS authenticates the issuer;
OpenID Connect Core 1.0 section 3.1.3.7 permits that in place of a signature check, and the
claim validation is delegated to `authlib.oidc.core.CodeIDToken` — authlib's own §3.1.3.7
validator, which checks `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `azp`, and `at_hash` (verified
against the access token, per §3.1.3.7 step 8). The handler then refuses
a userinfo response whose `sub` disagrees with the ID token's. `ServerMetadata.jwks_url` is carried through for a caller
that wants to verify signatures itself; this library does not fetch it.

`IdentityProfile.provider` is `oidc:<issuer>`, not a bare `oidc`. A `sub` is unique only
within an issuer, so two generic connections would otherwise collide on the
`(provider, subject)` pair that `identity_key()` recommends as a user-table primary key.

PKCE is mandatory here, not negotiated: a provider whose `code_challenge_methods_supported`
omits `S256` is refused at `preset` time. Since this preset sends no `nonce`, PKCE is the only
thing binding an authorization code to the session that requested it, so a config without it
would have no code-injection defense at all.

`discover` applies no scheme or host policy of its own, so a self-hosted IdP on a private
network needs no opt-in. Whether a given issuer may be reached is a deployment question,
and a check on the URL string cannot answer it anyway — a hostname resolving to an internal
address passes any such test. Both `discover` and `identity_handler` accept a
`transport_factory`, which is where that policy belongs: it controls the actual outbound
connection, so a caller can pin DNS to validated addresses or route through its own egress.

The endpoint URLs a configuration document names are used exactly as named, including the
scheme. HTTPS is deliberately not enforced: a document that advertises an `http://` token
endpoint is used at that URL, and `preset` will happily build a config that POSTs client
credentials there. Keeping the credential-bearing endpoints on HTTPS is the operator's
responsibility — this module only refuses to pretend the decision was made for you.

#### What this preset does not do

Each is a deliberate limitation rather than an oversight:

| Limitation | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Confidential clients only | `preset` requires a client secret; a public (native/SPA) client cannot be configured, though `ProviderConfig` models one |
| No `nonce`, and no per-request `prompt` / `login_hint` / `max_age` / `acr_values` / `ui_locales` / `display` / `id_token_hint` | `extra_params` is fixed on a frozen config, so a `nonce` through it would be one constant reused on every request — worse than omitting it. `nonce` is OPTIONAL for the code flow, and PKCE covers code injection — which is why `preset` *refuses* a provider advertising no `S256` method rather than configuring one without PKCE |
| No RP-Initiated Logout | `end_session_endpoint` is neither read nor carried on `ServerMetadata`, though authlib implements the URL builder |
| No `response_mode` | The query default is always used |
| A token response with no `id_token` is accepted | Section 3.1.3.3 requires one; identity falls back to userinfo alone, with a weaker claim to have vouched for it |
| A signed (`application/jwt`) userinfo response is refused | Signatures are not verified here, so it is refused rather than read unverified |

### Manual configuration

If your provider doesn't have a preset and doesn't implement OpenID Connect, configure it
directly.

```python
from pydantic import SecretStr
from apron_auth import ProviderConfig

config = ProviderConfig(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret=SecretStr("your-client-secret"),  # pragma: allowlist secret
    authorize_url="https://provider.com/oauth/authorize",
    token_url="https://provider.com/oauth/token",
    scopes=["read", "write"],
)
```

### Authorization URL

Build the URL to redirect the user to. State and PKCE are included automatically.

```python
from apron_auth import OAuthClient

client = OAuthClient(config)
url, pending_state = await client.get_authorization_url(
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
)
# Redirect the user to `url`.
# Hold onto `pending_state` — you'll need it for the callback.
```

### Code exchange

When the user comes back with an authorization code, exchange it for tokens.

```python
tokens = await client.exchange_code(
    code="authorization-code-from-callback",
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
    code_verifier=pending_state.code_verifier,
)
print(tokens.access_token)
print(tokens.refresh_token)
```

### Identity fetch (optional)

If you need normalized identity fields for login or account-linking flows,
fetch them after token exchange:

```python
tokens = await client.exchange_code(
    code="authorization-code-from-callback",
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
    code_verifier=pending_state.code_verifier,
)
identity = await client.fetch_identity(tokens)
print(identity.provider)        # "google", "github", etc.
print(identity.email)
print(identity.email_verified)
```

`fetch_identity` takes the `TokenSet` from `exchange_code` (or
`refresh_token`). It is narrowed to an `IdentityMaterial` — exposing
only the access token and, for OIDC providers, the ID token — before
being handed to the provider's identity handler, so handlers never
receive the refresh token or caller context.

Built-in identity handlers are inferred from standard Google, GitHub,
HubSpot, Microsoft, Atlassian, Typeform, Salesforce, Notion, and Linear
endpoint hostnames, so they apply to both the bundled `preset(...)`
configs and any manually constructed `ProviderConfig` pointing at those
hosts. For other providers, pass a custom `identity_handler` to
`OAuthClient`.
OAuth protocol endpoints come from the provider config; identity API
endpoints are provider-specific internals handled by the identity
handler.

Typeform's `/me` response does not include a stable, opaque user
identifier, so `IdentityProfile.subject` is always `None` for that
provider. The available alternatives are `IdentityProfile.email`
(stable but PII) and `IdentityProfile.username` (the Typeform
alias, which is user-mutable); callers that need a non-PII stable
handle must derive one themselves, for example by hashing
`email`.

Notion's `/v1/users/me` returns a bot user object. For external (public
OAuth) integrations where `bot.owner.type == "user"`, `fetch_identity`
maps owner user fields into `IdentityProfile`. For internal
workspace-owned integrations where `bot.owner.type == "workspace"`,
Notion does not expose end-user email, so `IdentityProfile.email` is
`None` by design.

HubSpot's `fetch_identity` calls the access-token introspection
endpoint, which mixes user and portal/account identity in one
response. `IdentityProfile.subject` and `IdentityProfile.email` map to
the HubSpot user (`user_id` and `user`); the portal (`hub_id`,
`hub_domain`) populates `IdentityProfile.tenancies` (see "Tenancy"
below). The full response — including `app_id`, `scopes`, and
`expires_in` — is preserved on `IdentityProfile.raw`. HubSpot does not
return an `email_verified` claim, a display name, or a user handle,
so those fields are always `None`.

#### Tenancy

`IdentityProfile.tenancies` answers "what scope of resources does this
token operate within?" — the workspace, organization, tenant,
instance, portal, or site the OAuth access token is bound to. It is a
tuple of `TenancyContext` entries because Atlassian OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
tokens can grant access to several Cloud sites at once and a singleton
shape would force a lossy "pick one" decision in the handler.

| Provider count | Provider examples                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `()`           | GitHub OAuth Apps, Typeform, consumer Google, personal Microsoft, Microsoft B2B guests |
| 1 entry        | Slack, Linear, Notion, single-domain Microsoft Entra, Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Workspace |
| Many entries   | Atlassian (Jira, Jira Service Management, Confluence); Microsoft Entra tenants with several verified domains |

Each `TenancyContext` exposes four normalized fields — `id`, `name`,
`domain`, `owns_email_domain` — plus a provider-specific `raw` payload
for fields that do not normalize cleanly. **Each normalized field may
independently be `None` (or `False` for `owns_email_domain`)** when
the provider's response does not assert that fact (for example,
Microsoft Entra workforce sign-in populates `id`, `name`, and `domain`
with `owns_email_domain=True` for each admin-verified domain of the
validated tenant; Google Workspace populates `domain` from the `hd`
claim and sets `owns_email_domain=True`; HubSpot populates only `id`
and `domain` with `owns_email_domain=False`). Persist `id` as the canonical key —
provider-mutable handles like Linear's `urlKey` should not be treated
as permanent identifiers.

```python
identity = await client.fetch_identity(tokens)
for tenancy in identity.tenancies:
    print(tenancy.id, tenancy.name, tenancy.domain)
```

### Identifying users

Two facts on `IdentityProfile` are load-bearing for identifying users
safely: `provider` (which IdP issued the token) and `subject` (the
provider's stable, opaque user ID). The recommended primary key for a
consumer's user or identity table is the tuple `(provider, subject)`,
exposed via the `identity_key()` helper:

```python
identity = await client.fetch_identity(tokens)
key = identity.identity_key()  # ("google", "g-1") or None
if key is None:
    raise AuthError("Provider did not return a stable subject")
user = get_or_create_by_identity_key(key)
```

Email is a **display label**, not an identity. Use `verified_email()`
to surface the email at the call site only when the provider verified
it; otherwise treat the address as untrusted user input:

```python
display = identity.verified_email()  # None if not verified by provider
```

The verified-email assertion proves the user once controlled the inbox
at the time of verification. It does **not** prove ongoing control,
current employment, or that the email's domain belongs to any
organization the user is affiliated with. For those questions, see
[Domain-bound tenancy access](#domain-bound-tenancy-access).

#### Anti-pattern: keying users by email

```python
# DON'T
user = get_by_email(identity.email)  # cross-provider hijack vector
```

Treating email as a stable cross-provider identifier lets any
identity that presents a verified copy of an existing user's email —
on any supported provider — silently link into that user's account.
The verified flag from a provider like GitHub is sticky once acquired;
there is no out-of-band revocation when the user loses control of the
mailbox. Use `(provider, subject)` instead.

#### Suggested schema

A consumer keeping a separate identity table makes the recipe
mechanical and supports explicit, opt-in cross-provider account
linking:

```
oauth_identity
  provider               TEXT     -- PK part 1: "google", "github", ...
  subject                TEXT     -- PK part 2: provider's stable opaque user ID
  user_id                FK -> user.id
  email_at_link          TEXT     -- audit snapshot, not a lookup field
  email_verified_at_link BOOLEAN
  linked_at              TIMESTAMP
```

The `user` row keeps `email` as a display field only. Cross-provider
linking ("the same person, multiple providers") becomes an explicit
ceremony: an already-authenticated user adds a second identity by
completing OAuth on the second provider while logged in via the
first. Email lookups never silently merge accounts.

### Domain-bound tenancy access

When a consumer wants to grant access to an organization on the basis
of the user's email *domain* — for example, "anyone from acme.com
joins the Acme tenant automatically" — the verified-email signal
alone is not sufficient. A verified email proves inbox control; it
does not prove that the IdP issuing the token controls the email's
domain.

apron-auth surfaces the stronger fact via
`IdentityProfile.owns_domain()`. This returns `True` only when the
provider asserts that some tenancy controls that domain (Google
Workspace via the `hd` claim, or Microsoft Entra workforce sign-in via
the validated tenant's admin-verified domains; capability flag below).
Gate on the `False` case to refuse domain-based grants:

```python
def join_org(identity: IdentityProfile, claimed_domain: str) -> Membership:
    domain = claimed_domain.strip().lower()
    if not identity.owns_domain(domain):
        raise AuthError(f"No domain-owning assertion for {domain}")
    return grant_membership(identity.identity_key(), domain)
```

Matching is exact once whitespace is trimmed and case is folded. A
parent domain does not confer ownership of its subdomains — a tenant
verified for `acme.com` does not satisfy a gate on `corp.acme.com`.

`owns_domain()` folds its argument for the comparison only; it does not
hand back a canonical form. Whatever key you persist is yours to
normalize. Canonicalize once and use that value for both the gate and
the write, as above — otherwise `" Example.COM "` passes the gate and
is then stored alongside `example.com` as a second membership row.

**Test the domain; do not pick one.** A single tenant can assert
several domains at once: every Entra tenant has an
`*.onmicrosoft.com` domain alongside any custom domain, and Microsoft
Graph does not guarantee the order it lists them in. Reducing that set
to one entry and comparing against it yields an arbitrary answer, and
persisting the reduction latches the arbitrary choice permanently:

```python
# DON'T — arbitrary which domain you get on a multi-domain tenant
owner = identity.domain_owning_tenancies()[0]
if owner.domain != claimed_domain:
    raise AuthError(...)
```

To enumerate or display the full set rather than test one domain, use
`domain_owning_tenancies()`, which returns every asserting tenancy:

```python
verified = [t.domain for t in identity.domain_owning_tenancies()]
# ["contoso.com", "contoso.co.uk", "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"]
```

Microsoft's assertion resolves the tenant's admin-verified domains from
a live directory call, so it can be withheld transiently — an outage,
throttling, or a tenant that has not consented leaves `tenancies=()`
and logs a warning rather than failing the sign-in. The assertion is
never fabricated, so the failure closes a domain gate rather than
opening one, but a consumer that *persists* the result should re-resolve
it rather than treating one absent assertion as durable. The extra call
needs no consent beyond the `User.Read` scope already in the preset's
`BASE_SCOPES`.

#### Refusing incapable providers at startup

`ProviderConfig.can_assert_domain_ownership` declares whether a
preset's tokens can *in principle* carry a domain-owning tenancy.
Consumers building a domain-gated tenancy flow can reject incapable
providers at startup, rather than discovering the gap at login time:

```python
config, _ = some_preset(client_id=..., client_secret=..., scopes=...)
if domain_gated_signin and not config.can_assert_domain_ownership:
    raise ConfigError(
        "This provider cannot assert domain ownership; do not "
        "wire it up for domain-gated tenancy."
    )
```

Per-provider capability:

| Provider     | `can_assert_domain_ownership` | Mechanism                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Google       | `True`                        | `hd` claim (Workspace accounts)          |
| Microsoft    | `True`                        | Validated ID token + tenant's admin-verified domains (workforce) |
| GitHub       | `False`                       | No structural mechanism                  |
| Slack        | `False`                       | Workspace is not a domain authority      |
| Linear       | `False`                       | Workspace is not a domain authority      |
| Notion       | `False`                       | Workspace is not a domain authority      |
| HubSpot      | `False`                       | Portal is not a domain authority         |
| Atlassian    | `False`                       | Site is not a domain authority           |
| Salesforce   | `False`                       | Custom-domain investigation deferred     |
| Typeform     | `False`                       | No tenancy concept                       |

`False` is the security-preserving default. Future provider opt-ins
are strictly additive — a flag flipping from `False` to `True` only
loosens a gate, never tightens one. Pin a known-good provider list in
your config if you want changes to require an explicit code review.

#### Safe email allowlists

A common pattern is granting a role (admin, member, …) based on a
specific email address. The safe variant always pairs the email
check with a domain-ownership check, so a verified email from an
incapable provider cannot satisfy the allowlist alone:

```python
ADMIN_EMAILS = {"founder@example.com"}

def is_admin(identity: IdentityProfile) -> bool:
    return (
        identity.owns_domain("example.com")
        and identity.verified_email() in ADMIN_EMAILS
    )
```

Without the `owns_domain()` check, any provider returning
`email_verified=True` for `founder@example.com` would grant admin —
including a personal GitHub account that happens to have
`founder@example.com` verified on it.

### Deprovisioning

When a user is offboarded by the IdP that controls their email's
domain (the Workspace admin disables the account, for example), the
provider's tokens stop refreshing. Consumers wanting their app
sessions to reflect that change in near-real-time must refresh on a
cadence shorter than the staleness window they are willing to accept.

apron-auth does not enforce refresh cadence. The recommended shape is:

- Issue your own short-lived application session (e.g. a JWT with a
  TTL of minutes, not hours).
- On session refresh, call `client.refresh_token(...)` against the
  provider; if refresh fails permanently (`PermanentOAuthError`),
  revoke the application session.
- For long-running background tasks that hold a refresh token, run
  the same check periodically.

There is no analogous deprovisioning path for providers that lack
domain-ownership (everything in the capability table above with
`False`). For those providers, deprovisioning at the OAuth layer
relies on the *user* revoking their authorization with the provider,
or the consumer maintaining an out-of-band revocation list.

### Token refresh

Refreshing can fail permanently (the user revoked access, the client was deregistered) or transiently (network blip, rate limit). apron-auth tells you which.

```python
from apron_auth import PermanentOAuthError

try:
    tokens = await client.refresh_token(tokens.refresh_token)
except PermanentOAuthError:
    # The token can't be recovered — delete it and re-authenticate the user.
    pass
```

By default, `invalid_grant`, `unauthorized_client`, and `invalid_client` are treated as permanent. If your provider uses non-standard error codes for the same thing, you can extend the set:

```python
client = OAuthClient(
    config,
    permanent_error_codes={"token_revoked", "account_suspended"},
)
```

These merge with the defaults — you can inspect them via `OAuthClient.DEFAULT_PERMANENT_ERROR_CODES`.

### Token revocation

```python
client = OAuthClient(config, revocation_handler=revocation_handler)
await client.revoke_token(tokens.access_token)
```

### State management

If you need to persist OAuth state across requests (e.g. between the redirect and the callback), implement the `StateStore` protocol.

```python
from apron_auth import StateStore, OAuthPendingState

class MyStateStore:
    async def save(self, state: OAuthPendingState) -> None:
        # Persist state, keyed by state.state.
        ...

    async def consume(self, state_key: str) -> OAuthPendingState | None:
        # Look up and invalidate in one step. Return None if it's missing or expired.
        ...

client = OAuthClient(config, state_store=MyStateStore())
url, pending_state = await client.get_authorization_url(
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
)

# When the callback arrives, pass the state parameter and the code.
# The store is consumed automatically.
tokens = await client.exchange_code(code="...", state="state-from-callback")
```

#### Carrying context through the flow

If your application needs to carry context through the OAuth flow (e.g. which user or tenant initiated it), pass `metadata` when building the authorization URL. apron-auth carries it opaquely through the `StateStore` and surfaces it on `TokenSet.context` after auto-consume.

```python
url, pending_state = await client.get_authorization_url(
    redirect_uri="https://yourapp.com/callback",
    metadata={"user_id": "U123", "tenant_id": "T456"},
)

# On callback, context comes back on the TokenSet.
tokens = await client.exchange_code(code="...", state="state-from-callback")
print(tokens.context["user_id"])    # "U123"
print(tokens.context["tenant_id"])  # "T456"

# Provider response extras (e.g. Slack's team_id) are separate.
print(tokens.metadata)  # {"team_id": "T123", ...}
```

## Connecting to an MCP server

When the provider is not a known preset but a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, `apron_auth.mcp` discovers its OAuth configuration at runtime (RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata + RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata) and, where the server supports it, registers a client dynamically (RFC 7591). The result folds into the same `ProviderConfig`/`OAuthClient` used everywhere else.

```python
from apron_auth import OAuthClient, mcp

# 1. Discover the server's OAuth endpoints.
meta = await mcp.discover("https://mcp.example.com", transport_factory=my_transport_factory)

# 2. Obtain a client identity, in the spec's priority order.
if my_pre_registered_client_id:  # an existing relationship with this server
    client_id, client_secret = my_pre_registered_client_id, my_pre_registered_secret
    registered_auth_method = None
elif meta.supports_cimd:  # CIMD — the forward path; you host the metadata document
    client_id = mcp.cimd_client_id("https://app.example.com/oauth/client-metadata.json")
    client_secret = None
    registered_auth_method = None
elif meta.registration_url:  # DCR — deprecated, kept for backward compatibility
    reg = await mcp.register_client(meta.registration_url, redirect_uri, transport_factory=my_transport_factory)
    client_id, client_secret = reg.client_id, reg.client_secret
    registered_auth_method = reg.token_endpoint_auth_method
else:
    raise RuntimeError("server offers no supported client-registration mechanism")

# 3. Build a ProviderConfig and drive the normal authorization-code flow.
config = mcp.to_provider_config(
    meta,
    client_id=client_id,
    client_secret=client_secret,
    registered_auth_method=registered_auth_method,
    redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
)
client = OAuthClient(config, transport_factory=my_transport_factory)
url, pending = await client.get_authorization_url()
# Redirect the user to `url`; on the callback, pass the `iss` query
# parameter so the issuer can be validated before the code is redeemed:
tokens = await client.exchange_code(
    code="code-from-callback",
    redirect_uri=pending.redirect_uri,
    code_verifier=pending.code_verifier,
    iss="iss-from-callback",
)
```

Public clients are supported end to end: a server that issues no secret yields `ClientRegistration.client_secret = None`, and `to_provider_config` sets `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `"none"`.

When using CIMD, you host the `client-metadata.json` yourself at the `client_id` URL — apron-auth is stateless and does not host it. The document must include `client_id`, `client_name`, and `redirect_uris`. Its `client_id` must equal that URL, and its `redirect_uris` must include the redirect you use in the flow; the authorization server fetches and validates the document. `mcp.cimd_client_id(url)` checks the URL is a well-formed CIMD identifier (`https` scheme, a document path, no userinfo or fragment); it does not fetch the URL.

Unlike DCR or pre-registered credentials — which are bound to the authorization server that issued them and must be re-registered when that server changes — a CIMD `client_id` is a self-hosted URL, portable across authorization servers with no re-registration.

`discover` records the authorization server's issuer, and `to_provider_config` carries it onto the `ProviderConfig`. Pass the callback's `iss` parameter (RFC 9207) to `exchange_code` and it is validated against that issuer **before** the code is redeemed, refusing an authorization-server mix-up. When the server advertises `iss` support, a callback that omits `iss` is also rejected. Presets carry no issuer and are unaffected.

Passing `registered_auth_method` lets the server's per-client choice (RFC 7591) win over the derivation from the advertised set — for example a server that supports both `client_secret_post` and `client_secret_basic` but registers a given client as `basic`-only. Omit it (or pass `None`) to derive the method from the client's secret and the server's advertised set.

### SSRF safety

Discovery, registration, the token request, and token revocation all fetch URLs taken from server-supplied metadata. `discover`, `register_client`, and `OAuthClient` each accept a **`transport_factory`** (`Callable[[str], httpx.AsyncBaseTransport]`) so the caller controls the actual outbound connection; the `OAuthClient` factory governs both the token request and revocation. For an **untrusted** `server_url` — for example one a user pasted — supply a transport that resolves DNS once and pins the connection to validated public addresses. The built-in HTTPS-only requirement and non-public-IP-literal block are defense-in-depth; they do **not** stop a hostname that resolves to an internal address. A `url_validator` hook is also accepted for URL-string policy.

## Provider presets

| Typeform   | `typeform.preset(...)`   | —                      | `False`                    |
| HubSpot    | `hubspot.preset(...)`    | DELETE refresh-token   | `False`                    |

## Scope reduction tiers

Some providers' revocation endpoints fully remove the user's portal-level OAuth grant; others only invalidate the current token while the grant lingers. apron-auth surfaces this difference as `ProviderConfig.disconnect_fully_revokes` so consumers can offer the right scope-reduction UX without rebuilding the per-provider truth table inline.

| Tier | Meaning                                                                                                             | When                                |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | Automatic scope reduction: revoke + re-auth presents a fresh consent screen, narrower scopes take effect.           | `disconnect_fully_revokes is True`  |
| 3    | Manual via provider settings: deep-link the user to the provider's app management page; revoke alone is not enough. | `disconnect_fully_revokes is False` |

```python
from apron_auth.providers import google, hubspot

google_config, _ = google.preset(...)
hubspot_config, _ = hubspot.preset(...)

if google_config.disconnect_fully_revokes:
    ...  # tier 1: trigger revoke + re-auth in-app
else:
    ...  # tier 3: open the provider's app-management page
```

The default for unconfigured `ProviderConfig` is `False` — under-claiming the capability harmlessly falls back to the manual deep-link path.

### Trello

Trello's API uses OAuth 1.0 exclusively — there is no OAuth 2.0 support yet. Atlassian has [announced plans](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-89-introducing-oauth2-to-trello/90359) to introduce OAuth 2.0 (3LO) for Trello, but no launch date has been committed.

Because apron-auth is an OAuth 2.0 library, Trello is not supported. If your application needs Trello, handle its OAuth 1.0 flow separately (e.g. with [authlib](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/oauth1.html)). [apron-tools](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/apron-tools) provides Trello tool definitions — you just need to bring your own token.

When Trello ships OAuth 2.0, a preset will be added here.

## Error hierarchy

All exceptions inherit from `OAuthError`.

| Exception             | When it's raised                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TokenExchangeError`  | Code exchange failed at the token endpoint.                                                                     |
| `TokenRefreshError`   | Refresh failed, but it might work if you try again (transient).                                                 |
| `PermanentOAuthError` | The token is gone — `invalid_grant`, `unauthorized_client`, or `invalid_client`. Delete it and re-authenticate. |
| `RevocationError`     | The provider rejected the revocation request.                                                                   |
| `StateError`          | OAuth state was invalid, expired, or already used.                                                              |
| `ConfigurationError`  | Something's wrong with the provider config (e.g. missing `redirect_uri`).                                       |
| `McpDiscoveryError`   | MCP OAuth metadata discovery failed — a blocked or rejected URL, or unreachable or malformed server metadata.   |
| `McpRegistrationError`| MCP OAuth dynamic client registration (RFC 7591) failed at the server.                                          |
| `OidcDiscoveryError`  | Reading an OpenID provider's configuration document failed, or the document named a different issuer.           |

## Logging

apron-auth logs through the standard library and configures nothing on
your behalf. It attaches a `NullHandler` to its root logger, so it stays
silent until your application opts in — without one, Python's last-resort
fallback would write warnings to your stderr.

Loggers are named after their module, so the `apron_auth` logger is the
single point of control for the whole library:

```python
import logging

logging.getLogger("apron_auth").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("apron_auth").addHandler(my_handler)

# Or target one module.
logging.getLogger("apron_auth.providers.microsoft").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

| Logger                           | Emits                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apron_auth.stores`              | Expired OAuth state discarded on lookup.                     |
| `apron_auth.providers.microsoft` | Withheld tenancy assertions; ID-token claim parsing.         |
| `apron_auth.providers.github`    | Grant revocation the provider did not confirm.               |
| `apron_auth.providers.hubspot`   | Revocation returning an unexpected status.                   |
| `apron_auth.providers.notion`    | Revocation returning an unexpected status.                   |

Two levels are used. `WARNING` marks a capability that degraded without
raising — a revocation the provider would not confirm, or a
domain-ownership assertion withheld because a directory lookup failed.
Both deserve an operator's attention precisely because they do not
surface as exceptions: the call returns, and the effect is silent. A
withheld assertion in particular makes domain-gated access refuse.
`DEBUG` carries diagnostic detail: expired state, and provider response
parsing that is useful when a response format changes.

There is no `logger` parameter to inject. The logging hierarchy is the
injection point: because every module logs to its own `__name__`,
configuring `apron_auth` reaches all of them, and adapters, filters, and
`contextvars` compose with it in the usual way.

### What is never logged

Access tokens, refresh tokens, client secrets, and ID-token payload bytes
are never written to logs at any level. Exception *values* are not logged
either — in their place goes whichever non-sensitive primitive actually
carries diagnostic signal, such as an HTTP status code or an exception
class name. A raised exception's rendering can embed the request that
carried a credential, and for some providers a token travels in the URL
path, so
the exception value is not safe to emit generically.

This is a contract, not an implementation detail: if you find a
credential in log output, treat it as a bug and report it.

## Development

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
make setup    # Install uv, create venv, sync deps, install pre-commit hooks
