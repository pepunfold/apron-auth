    ``list[ScopeMetadata]`` for a consent picker. apron-auth declares

        label: Short human-readable name for the consent picker.
        description: Longer explanation of what granting this scope does;
            should match the provider's authorize-page wording where

            the consent picker.
        required: When ``True``, the consumer's UI should not allow the

            flow itself depends on it (e.g. ``openid`` for identity,

class ProviderConfig(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    """OAuth provider configuration — endpoints, credentials, behavior.

    Attributes:
        disconnect_fully_revokes: Whether ``revoke_token`` removes the
            user's portal-level OAuth grant.

            When ``True``, calling
            :meth:`~apron_auth.client.OAuthClient.revoke_token` is
            sufficient to force a fresh consent screen on the next
            authorization flow — enabling automatic scope-reduction
            (tier 1) end-to-end inside the OAuth flow.

            When ``False``, revocation only invalidates the current
            token. A subsequent authorization flow reuses the existing
            portal-level grant and the user keeps their previously-
            granted scopes regardless of what's requested. Consumers
            must surface a deep link to the provider's app-management
            settings (tier 3) for the user to remove the grant
            manually.

            Defaults to ``False``. Over-claiming silently breaks scope
            reduction; under-claiming harmlessly falls back to the
            manual deep-link path.
        scope_metadata: Consent-UI metadata for the cross-cutting scopes
            the preset injects into :attr:`scopes` (e.g. ``openid``,
            ``offline_access``). Empty when the preset does not inject
            any scopes of its own. Consumers building a consent picker
            should concatenate apron-tools' ``CapabilityGroup.metadata()``
            with this list to cover both tool-level and cross-cutting
            scopes without a parallel hand-maintained table.
        required_scope_families: Set-level scope constraints expressing
            "at least one of these scope sets must be requested".  Each
            inner list is an "at-least-one-of" group; the constraint is
            satisfied when the final scope selection contains at least
            one scope drawn from at least one family.  Used by providers
            (e.g. Slack) whose token endpoint applies a set-level OR
            rule that cannot be expressed as per-scope
            :attr:`ScopeMetadata.required`.  A consent picker can
            enforce the constraint generically without provider-specific
            knowledge.  Defaults to empty (no set-level constraint).
        can_assert_domain_ownership: ``True`` only for providers whose
            tokens can in principle carry a tenancy that asserts the
            authenticated user belongs to the email's domain (e.g.
            Google Workspace via the ``hd`` claim). Set by the preset
            at construction time. Consumers building domain-gated
            tenancy can refuse to wire up an incapable provider at
            startup rather than discovering the gap at login time.
            Defaults to ``False``.
        implicit_scopes: Mapping from a high-level scope to the
            finer-grained scopes it implicitly includes — used to avoid
            false "missing scope" reports. Holding a high-level scope
            often implies holding narrower ones: a token with GitHub's
            ``repo`` implicitly holds ``public_repo``, so checking that
            token for ``public_repo`` alone would wrongly report it as
            missing. :meth:`resolve_implicit_scopes` expands a granted set
            against this mapping. Set by the preset; empty when a provider
            has no such relationships.
        issuer: Expected issuer identifier (RFC 8414) of the authorization
            server, used to validate the authorization-response ``iss``
            parameter (RFC 9207) before a code is redeemed. ``None`` when no
            issuer is known, which disables issuer validation entirely —
            the default for presets that do not opt in.
        require_iss: Whether an authorization response that omits ``iss``
            must be rejected. Set ``True`` when the authorization server
            advertises support for the ``iss`` parameter, so a stripped
            ``iss`` cannot silently bypass the mix-up check. Ignored when
            :attr:`issuer` is ``None``. Defaults to ``False``.

            The default leaves a hand-built config that sets :attr:`issuer`
            but not this flag catching only a *mismatched* ``iss``, not a
            *stripped* one — an attacker who removes ``iss`` slips past. A
            caller that knows its authorization server emits ``iss`` should
            set this ``True`` to close that gap; :func:`apron_auth.mcp.to_provider_config`
            does so automatically from the discovered metadata.
        resource: RFC 8707 resource indicator identifying the service the
            issued token is audience-bound to. When set, it must be an
            absolute URI without a fragment (RFC 8707); an invalid value is
            rejected at construction. It is sent on the authorization request
            and on the token-exchange and refresh requests, so the
            authorization server can restrict the token's audience to this
            resource. ``None`` (the default) emits no ``resource`` parameter
            anywhere, preserving behavior for providers that do not use
            resource indicators.

        id: Tenant identifier as exposed by the provider (e.g. Slack
            ``team_id``, Linear organization id, Atlassian ``cloudId``,
            HubSpot ``hub_id``). Cast to ``str`` where the provider
            returns a numeric identifier so the contract is stable. It
            is a provider-assigned identifier for binding and display —
            not itself an authorization grant. Consumers gating
            domain or tenant access must do so on
            :attr:`owns_email_domain` (via
            :meth:`IdentityProfile.owns_domain`), never on the mere
            presence of an ``id``.
        name: Human-readable display name for the tenant (e.g. Slack
            ``team_name``, Linear organization name).
        domain: Domain or canonical URL for the tenant (e.g. Slack
            ``team_domain``, HubSpot ``hub_domain``, Atlassian site URL,
            Salesforce MyDomain host).
        raw: Provider-specific payload for this tenant (Slack-namespaced
            claims, Notion ``workspace_id``, Atlassian ``avatarUrl`` /
            ``scopes``, etc.). Used as the escape hatch for fields not
            covered by the three normalized slots above.
        owns_email_domain: ``True`` only when the provider asserts that
            this tenancy controls the email domain of the authenticated
            user (e.g. Google with the ``hd`` claim present). Set per
            identity at ``fetch_identity`` time by the provider handler.
            It must be set only from a verified, non-mutable assertion
            (a domain-authority claim or an admin-verified directory
            lookup) — never from a self-assertable claim such as a raw
            email address or UPN. A provider may set it on several
            tenancies at once when it asserts several domains for one
            tenant, so callers gating domain-bound tenant grants should
            use :meth:`IdentityProfile.owns_domain` rather than
            inspecting this flag directly. Defaults to ``False``.
